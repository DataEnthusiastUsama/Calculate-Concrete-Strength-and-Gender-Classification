# Calculate-Concrete-Strength-and-Gender-Classification

Project 1: Gender Classification

This project focuses on gender classification using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains images categorized as male and female. The goal was to build and compare different models for accurate gender prediction.

Key Highlights:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, including countplots and image visualization.
Implemented a Base SVM (LinearSVC) model as a baseline for gender classification.
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with 3 Conv2D layers and 3 Maxpooling2D layers for improved accuracy.
Achieved a test accuracy of over 90% using the CNN model.
Leveraged libraries like Keras, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for model development and visualization.


Project 2: Cement Strength Regression

This project involves predicting cement strength using regression techniques and neural networks. The dataset used contains features related to cement components and environmental conditions. The objective was to build accurate regression models to predict cement strength.

Key Highlights:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's features and distribution.
Utilized Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression algorithms to predict cement strength.
Implemented a neural network with an architecture tailored to the problem, achieving a test mean squared error lower than regression models.
Employed libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras for regression modeling and neural network development.
